# Dev Installation - Linux Setup

#### How to get a Linux machine if you don't have one?

```
FYI... I have a MacBook and plan on working on a Ubuntu Machine

Download Ubuntu Desktop image from Ubuntu website
Install VirtualBox
Create a New Virtual Machine
When you run the virtual machine, it'll ask for the image path. Point it to the Ubuntu image.
You'll be able to setup your virtual machine as similar as having a brand new hardware installing the OS
You'll be able to setup login credentials as well
Once done, setup will ask for a restart of the machine. You're all set to use your Ubuntu machine!!

It may be obvious to some, however to reiterate, if you install a software on your OS now, its state is
stored. Which means, if you power off your machine and turn it on back again, your installations stay.
```

#### Basic Setup

Whenever you install any Linux OS, there are few standard set of instructions that makes sense to execute to have the most up to date system.

```
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get update

```

Install some softwares that you would like based on the kind of work you do. Here are some that I'd like:

```
Atom
PyCharm
```
