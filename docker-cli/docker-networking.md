# Docker Networking

To do input/output with a detached container use network connections or shared volumes.

By default, all containers have networking enabled and they can make any outgoing connections. The operator can completely disable networking with `docker run --network none` which disables all incoming and outgoing networking. In cases like this, you would perform I/O through files or `STDIN` and `STDOUT` only.

## Network Settings
```
--dns=[]           : Set custom dns servers for the container
--network="bridge" : Connect a container to a network
                      'bridge': create a network stack on the default Docker bridge
                      'none': no networking
                      'container:<name|id>': reuse another container's network stack
                      'host': use the Docker host network stack
                      '<network-name>|<network-id>': connect to a user-defined network
--network-alias=[] : Add network-scoped alias for the container
--add-host=""      : Add a line to /etc/hosts (host:IP)
--mac-address=""   : Sets the container's Ethernet device's MAC address
--ip=""            : Sets the container's Ethernet device's IPv4 address
--ip6=""           : Sets the container's Ethernet device's IPv6 address
--link-local-ip=[] : Sets one or more container's Ethernet device's link local IPv4/IPv6 addresses
```
