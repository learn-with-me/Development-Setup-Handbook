# Themes

MkDocs includes two built-in themes (`mkdocs` and `readthedocs`) by default.
Additional themes may be installed as desired.

If you're not using the default theme, stop wasting time search for a good one. `mkdocs-material` [docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is by far the most popular theme at the moment.

## Installing theme

```sh
$ pip install -e mkdocs-material
```
