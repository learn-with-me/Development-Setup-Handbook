# Development Setup

Everything you need to know about getting started with listed technology.
Goal of writing this book is to documenting most of the setup steps that we normally come across and have them be least of our problems.

This book acts as a reference guide to common commands. You may or may not see the documentation for the latest version, however the book should still enable to get going and start working with the basics.
