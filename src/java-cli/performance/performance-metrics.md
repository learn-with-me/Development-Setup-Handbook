# Application Performance Metrics

Performance is a key usability and quality metric. Phrases like making fast and improving scalability are vague and subjective and don't make very good performance targets. As a result, the industry has come up with widely accepted terms for quantifying performance:

* **Latency \(Response time\)** - amount of time in ms, required to complete a unit of work
* **Elapsed time** - measures time taken for a batch of operations to complete
* **Throughput** - amount of work an application can accomplish per unit of time \(seconds\)
