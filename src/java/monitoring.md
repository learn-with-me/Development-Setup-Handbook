# Monitoring

## What is JMX?

The `Java virtual machine (Java VM)` has built-in `instrumentation` that enables you to monitor and manage it using the `Java Management Extensions (JMX)` technology. These built-in management utilities are often referred to as `out-of-the-box management tools` for the Java VM. You can also monitor any appropriately instrumented applications using the `JMX API`.

## Enabling JMX

To enable and configure the out-of-the-box JMX agent so that it can monitor and manage the Java VM, you must set certain system properties when you start the Java VM. A full set of out-of-the-box management properties described [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdevf). Alternatively you can use a tool that complies to the JMX specification, such as [JConsole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JConsole).

## Metrics Library

Instrumentation can be achieved by using `native JMX` or using a modular project like [Metrics](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.2.0/) (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics)). `Metrics` provides a powerful way to measure the behaviour of your critical components and reporting them to a variety of systems like, JConsole, or making them available through a web server. To install Metrics, we only have to add metrics dependency.

> Note: If you are planning to use `Metrics` in production code, it is highly recommended that you put metrics logic into `AOP` whenever possible, to avoid mixing instrumentation code with business logic.

`Metrics` we can use 6 types of metrics:

1. **Gauges**: an instantaneous measurement of a discrete value.
2. **Counters**: a value that can be incremented and decremented. Can be used in queues to monitorize the remaining number of pending jobs.
3. **Meters**: measure the rate of events over time. You can specify the rate unit, the scope of events or event type.
4. **Histograms**: measure the statistical distribution of values in a stream of data.
5. **Timers**: measure the amount of time it takes to execute a piece of code and the distribution of its duration.
6. **Healthy checks**: as his name suggests, it centralize our serviceâ€™s healthy checks of external systems.
