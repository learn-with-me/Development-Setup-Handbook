# Node.js Dependency Management

Dependencies in Node.js are managed using a [package manager](./package-manager/). However it is important to categorize dependencies correctly.

## Types of dependencies

- dependencies
- devDependencies
- peerDepedencies

## Tools

### Babel

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

Babel can also convert JSX syntax!
