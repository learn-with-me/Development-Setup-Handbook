# CDN Images

Downloading a lot of images or even large images on a website consumes a lot of bandwidth. Adding network bandwidth overhead to it makes it even worse. Image cache servers come to resue, along with other helpful features like resizing images, etc.

## wsrv.nl

[wsrv.nl](https://images.weserv.nl/docs/) is an image cache & resize service. Our servers resize your image, cache it worldwide, and display it.
