# Development Setup

Everything you need to know about given technologies to get started with developing applications locally. Goal of writing this book is to documenting most of the setup issues that we normally come across and have them be least of our problems.

This book is divided into sections per technology/tool/library, and acts as a reference guide to common commands. You may or may not have the latest and greatest development machine, however this book is going to help you jump right in and start working without basic issues.

> Source of inspiration: I've been making huge ass notes about everything for a while. Having the need to refer these notes over and over again originated the idea of writing it into a book instead. The idea of breaking down the book into smaller components came from running across Kyle Simpson's book called "You don't know JS". I really liked the idea, its neat, manageable. Hence this book.

## Cheatsheet

This book does contain handy cheatsheet, which will be maintained to our best efforts. By no means this is meant to cover all versions and all aspects but to give you a detailed idea of handling a technology development.

```
1. Original documentation. These are the best, may or may not be written very well, but usually give you a lot of what is required.
2. MacOS App - Dash (collective documentation of multiple languages)
3. Personalized docs. What I have here. I find it fastest approach for me.

So, whatever works, is the best for you. You'll need to figure that out by experience.
```

## Deployment

This book currently does not have the capability to bundle itself or auto-deploy. I am using GitBook to write the book. For some reason, build process is broken. I am hoping to find some time in coming weeks to add that. Feel free to take it up if this is something that you'd like to contribute on.

## Contributions

We welcome all contributions. Please feel free to add support for languages/libraries that you would like to see as part of this book. I've tried to keep a similar format for all the topics. When contributing, it'll be really helpful if you could account for the same.
