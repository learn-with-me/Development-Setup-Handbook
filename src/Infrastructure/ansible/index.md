# Ansible

## Ansible Builder

## Ansible Semaphore

[Ansible Semaphore](https://snapcraft.io/semaphore) is beautiful web interface for running Ansible playbooks. If your project has grown and deploying from the terminal is no longer for you then Ansible Semaphore is what you need.

## Event-driven Ansible

Event-Driven Ansible provides the event-handling capability needed to automate time-consuming tasks and respond to changing conditions in any IT domain. 

Event-Driven Ansible can process events containing discrete intelligence about conditions in the IT environment, determine the appropriate response to the event, then execute automated actions to address or remediate the event.
