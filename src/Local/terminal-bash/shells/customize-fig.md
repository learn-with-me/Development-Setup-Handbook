Fig lets you add visual autocomplete to any CLI tool or script.

## Font

A better font for coding and terminals.
Reading lots of text on screen gives me headaches at times.
There are some amazing fonts that can be used to make this a whole lot easier.

I use https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode in almost all applications.  I've updated it for terminals, IDEs, and even default fonts in web browsers.  :heart:

making the terminal pretty and more functional (there are many of these, but I use this one a bit customized)

and ... probably the most used terminal trick is [reverse-search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tToorVswApk)
I think it is hard to find what I need (since the view port is only one line) this plugin super charges reverse search with PECO
