# Spring Boot

* [Terms](./terms.md)

## Key terms to understand

* `Bean`, any Spring-managed resource is referred to as a bean. Beans can utilize any interface implementation to satisfy their dependency.
* `Interfaces` - The use of interfaces also allows Spring to utilize JDK dynamic proxies (the `Proxy pattern`) to provide powerful concepts such as aspect-oriented programming (`AOP`) for crosscutting concerns.
* `Dependency injection` (DI), a concept that describes how dependent objects are connected at runtime by an external party. The DI implementation is based on JavaBeans and Interfaces.
* `Inversion of Control` (IoC), is a design principle in which generic reusable components are used to control the execution of problem-specific code, as in retrieving dependencies.
* `Aspect-oriented programming` (AOP), provides the ability to implement crosscutting logic — that is, logic that applies to many parts of your application — in a single place and to have that logic applied across your application automatically.
