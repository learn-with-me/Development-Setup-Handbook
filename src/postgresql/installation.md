# Local Installation

Spinning up a container using Docker would be a preferred approach.
Following instructions show various methods in installing postgres server locally.

## via Docker Compose

### Installation

Configuration yaml

```yaml
version: '3.6'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14.7
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
    - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgrespassword
volumes:
  db_data:
```

Create the configuration yaml and run the following command:

```sh
# Start postgres server
$ docker-compose up -d

# Go to psql terminal
$ docker-compose exec <db_container_name> psql postgres <user>
$ docker-compose exec <db_container_name> psql -U <user>
```

### Manage DB Service

pg_ctl is a utility to initialize, start, stop, or control a PostgreSQL server.

```sh
# Display command options
$ pg_ctl --help
```

## via Homebrew:

The database will be initialized during installation, so there isnâ€™t a need to run initdb

```
$ brew install postgres
```

> Here is a quick way of knowing if Postgres was installed via brew, brew initializes the database during installation by `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres` this creating the directory specified.

### Manage DB Service

```sh
# Starts as a background service
$ brew services start postgresql

# Stop the service manually
$ brew services stop postgresql

# Restart the service
$ brew services restart postgresql
```

### Uninstallation

```sh
# If installed via homebrew
$ brew remove postgresql
```

## via Native App

Download and install from http://postgresapp.com/
A native macOS app that runs in the menubar without the need of an installer.

(Another graphical installer alternative: https://www.bigsql.org/postgresql/installers.jsp)

```sh
# Configure PATH
sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
    echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp

# OR
PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin:$PATH"
```

> Note: If you are going to use the app, it is recommended to uninstall other PostgreSQL installations due to port conflicts.

### Uninstallation

Removing app from Applications folder will be good enough. Just clean the PATH as well.

## Verification

```sh
# Verify if the app is installed already
$ which postgres

# Display installed Postgres version
$ postgres --version

# Verify if the app is installed already
$ which psql

# Open psql command line, if installed correctly
$ psql -h localhost
```
