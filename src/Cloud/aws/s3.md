## Notes

### s3 ls vs s3api list-buckets

1. `aws s3 ls`: This command is part of the high-level (s3) commands provided by the AWS CLI. It lists all the S3 buckets when used without any arguments, and when used with a bucket name, it lists all the objects within that bucket. The output is simpler and more human-readable.

2. `aws s3api list-buckets`: This command is part of the low-level (s3api) commands provided by the AWS CLI. It lists all the S3 buckets in your AWS account, and provides more detailed information about each bucket, such as creation date. The output is in JSON format, which is more machine-readable and can be useful for scripting purposes.
