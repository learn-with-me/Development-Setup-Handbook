# Design Systems

The Flutter SDK comes with two types of widget libraries to support `Material` and `Cupertino` design systems.

## Material Design

Material-Design is developed by Google which can be used to develop apps across different platforms — Android, iOS, web, and desktop platforms.

## Cupertino Design

Cupertino-Design is developed by Apple; hence it is based on Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (iOS design language).
