# Flutter Mobile-app development

## Flutter

`Flutter` is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

Internally, Flutter consists of a `framework` built with `Dart` and `rendering engine` mostly built with `C++`.

## Dart

Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.

## Flutter vs Dart

Dart is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, server-side programming, and mobile app development.

Flutter, on the other hand, is a UI SDK specifically designed for building high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps. Flutter has more app-specific libraries, more often on user interface elements
