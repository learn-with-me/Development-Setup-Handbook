# Creating a new project

If you're using `Visual Studio Code` editor, press `Cmd + Shift + P` to open command pallete and type in `Flutter` to create a new application. Follow instructions thereafter.

## Connected Devices

I had two devices listed there:

1. `MacOS` - because I am working on a macbook
2. `Chrome` - because Chrome is installed on this machine and is my default browser

To bring up an Android emulator, I'll need to perform additional steps.

## Running the application

```sh
$ flutter run
```
