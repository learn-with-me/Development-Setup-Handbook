# Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) calls itself a microframework. It provides the basics, and you download third-party packages to supplement it as needed. It’s smaller than Django, and faster to learn when you’re getting started.

Flask is synchronous, based on WSGI rather than ASGI. A new project called [quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/) is replicating Flask and adding ASGI support.
