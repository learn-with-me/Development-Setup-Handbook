# Package Managers

Package managers have evolved over the last few years. And because of that, Node has a few different options. Most popular of them being `npm`

```sh
# List all globally installed dependencies
npm list -g

# find out where global packages are installed by default
npm config get prefix
```

## Options

- [npm](./npm.md)
- [yarn](./yarn.md)
- [pnpm](./pnpm.md)
