$ mkdir -p /data/db            # Create the directory to which the mongod process will write data
By default, the mongod process uses the /data/db. If you create a directory other than this one, you must specify that
directory in the dbpath option when starting the mongod process.

$ sudo chmod a+rw /data/db     # Set read and write permissions for the data directory
$ mongod                       # Run MongoD

Begin using MongoDB
$ mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017
When you run mongo without any arguments, the mongo shell will attempt to connect to the MongoDB instance running on the
localhost interface on port 27017
--host command line option to specify the localhost address and port that the mongod listens on
