# Homebrew

Missing MacOS package manager. Installs common libraries and utilities not bundled with OSX. Typically these are development related libraries. Installation is dependent on `XCode command line` tools \(large dependency\) and `ruby` to be installed.

Default package install location is `/usr/local`

##### Installation

```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
OR

Make sure the following is set in your path
$ export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

##### Commands

```
$ brew --version

$ brew doctor

$ brew update
This will update your Homebrew formula list in local with latest version. Note, this doesn’t update all your installed
